# Workflow

**At the tactical level,** the process is structured as follows:

- Moving cards from left to right if you use the board, or
- Gradually changing the status of a task from Todo to Done if you do not check the board.

The tactical level is described here: [Tactical Workflow](./jira-workflow.md).

**At the strategic level,** the process could be based on a type of a Agile managment system, such as Scrum or Kanban, or any variety of them. So, it is. Currently, we base on the book [Shape Upüìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), but adapted to our specific needs. Due to our non-rigid and relatively low output, we do not have a fixed 6-week sprint time.

What we take from the book:

1. **Planning** still happens in a sort of sprint format. Each sprint has either a goal or a theme.
2. **No backlog** concept is adopted, but with some differences. The book states that ideas and planned tasks do not go into the tracker until they are ready to work on. They can be planned anywhere but not in the task tracker.
	- I don't see anything wrong with also using Jira for this because a Jira ticket is a convenient unit to absorb information about a task, facilitate discussions, and develop ideas and plan work. It can also be used to gather information about an elusive bug.
	- Therefore, you can keep a newly formed idea or caught bug in a notebook or somewhere else. But you can also put it in Jira. However, tickets that have not reached the ToDo status are not considered part of the task queue; they are just notes, discussion topics, and memory joggers.

3. [Cool-down period üìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#cool-down) is inserted between sprints. It will always be 2 weeks (but can be one). During cool-down, you do everything you wanted to do but didn't get around to, and things you're unsure will make it into a planned sprint. This can include [fixing non-urgent bugs üìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#what-about-bugs), updating dependencies, minor automation tasks, non-urgent old issues. Basically, anything. Even a small feature can be included in cool-down (with approval). Cool-down tasks can be accumulated in Jira or collected separately (see previous point).
	- If you don't yet have a collection of your own tasks for cool-down, you can take something appealing from the subtasks of a ticket.

- **Goals for the next sprint** will be determined during these two weeks.
	- It's important to understand whether you are currently working in sprint mode or have moved into cool-down, and ensure this understanding matches that of the rest of the team.

4. It's useful to be aware of the concepts of [scopes üìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.3-chapter-12) and [hill charts üìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-13) and use them. Currently, we break down tasks fairly small, but over time they will become larger, and you will gain more independence. For completing a large ticket, the previously mentioned [emoji-based to-do lists](./jira-workflow.md#Planning) can be used, but when grouping task lists, remember the ‚Äúhill charts.‚Äù

5. We adopt a set of components for a [shaped task üìö](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06): problem, appetite (big batch or small batch), solution, rabbit holes, and no-gos.

6. And other details as well. We won't rewrite the entire book here.
